# VernEngine: Vernacular Engine  🌐🎓

### "Because language should never be a barrier to knowledge. Also, because we're awesome like that." 😎

## Overview

Welcome to VernEngine, the one-stop solution for all your e-learning video transcription and translation needs. Born from the marriage of `ffmpeg` and `Whisper`, VernEngine aims to make e-learning content more accessible.

## Future Scope 🚀

We're not stopping at just subtitles! Soon, VernEngine will be equipped with features to translate those subtitles into various languages. Stay tuned!

## What Does This Script Do? 🤔

1. **Converts a video to MP4 format**: So mainstream, yet so useful.
2. **Extracts audio from the video**: We like to listen. 🎧
3. **Transcribes the audio to text**: Your personal, non-awkward secretary.
4. **Generates an SRT file**: No, not a sports car.
5. **Burns the subtitles into the video**: Hotter than dragon breath. 🔥

## Installation & Dependencies 🛠️

### "Dependencies? Where we're going, we don't need dependencies. Just kidding, we totally do."

First, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. If not, get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next, install the required Python packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We're standing on the shoulders of giants:

- `Whisper` for speech-to-text
- `pydub` for audio manipulation
- `ffmpeg` for video and audio processing

**Note**: `ffmpeg` should be installed manually. Get it [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## How to Use 🚀

### "So simple, even a caveman could do it. But please, don't let your pet caveman near your computer."

1. Place your video file (`test.mp4`) in the project directory.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Sit back and enjoy your subtitled video. Or don't. We're not your mom.
